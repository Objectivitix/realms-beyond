          <p class="para">I still think about you.</p>
          <p class="para">You'd think that abandoning the cosmos, moving across the country, getting married, and building a new home would do it. But the past doesn't let go so easily.</p>
          <p class="para">Or maybe I don't let go so easily.</p>
          <p class="para">When the neighbors' lights extinguish, when the vast quilt of darkness falls upon the backyard and a weak thread of moonlight weaves past the spindly branches and slips through the curtains ajar, the past sinks its glacial fangs into my soul. I don't know what hurts more, the earliest memories or the latest ones. I guess they torture me equally.</p>
          <p class="para">From the decades of gently throbbing regret—that's the standout emotion, regret—one memory never fails to surface: that cold interstellar oblivion, indifferent space dotted by unreachable stars, a world of desolate emptiness. Our story's end: a final whimper in the dark. You gave me a parting gift, too, an answer to the question that has been slithering at the back of mind for eons. Yet I felt no closure, let alone catharsis.</p>
          <p class="para">I wish you never boarded that ship. You'd have kept me guessing, though I would much prefer you as a sorrowful mystery than a cruel memory.</p>
          <p class="para">But sometimes, times like tonight, times when it really hurts, I wish we never met at all.</p>

        <div class="scene">
          <p class="para">I'm that whirlwind state of melancholy again, walking the line between wake and sleep, eased and wounded by the lullabies of yesteryear. I want to fall off the deep end, want the world—and the past and its barbs—to fade away. But the sweet liberation of unconsciousness never comes.</p>
          <p class="para">Tonight my thoughts wander to our encounter on <i class="italic">Hypatia</i>. The first time I had seen you in nine years, and it was on a research spaceship. I recall standing in the spacious lobby for a good twenty seconds, processing your presence, my lips parted but made no sound. What were the odds that you had also pursued the cosmos? And what were the odds that you had become my partner in this mission?</p>
          <p class="para">You were faster to speak.</p>
          <p class="para">"Hey. It's been some time. Michael got pretty sick at the last minute, so they replaced him with me."</p>
          <p class="para">Concise and business-like. I was still half-stunned, lost in my reflections, when you spoke again.</p>
          <p class="para">"I, uh, haven't been briefed much. Why don't you show me around the ship?"</p>
          <p class="para">Guess small talk was not an option. I nodded, let out a feeble "sure," and started the tour in the lobby. I explained to you the purpose of every button, showed you the contents of every cupboard, taught you how to operate the holographic information panels. You kept the replies terse, the questions practical, often only nodding in understanding. I led you down narrow hallways cast in a serene glow from overhead azure lights and into storage rooms, greenhouses, and laboratories. I showed you the observatory, which served close to no purpose on a vessel of biological research. I didn't tell you it was my favorite place, didn't tell you I loved contemplating the galactic scenery, loved sitting in the glass protrusion and gazing upon pinpoints and clusters of light we call stars. And of course, I didn't tell you—didn't want to acknowledge it myself—that this great canvas on which each insignificant dot told a celestial story sometimes stirred up memories of a bygone friend and distant night skies.</p>
          <p class="para">So instead, I left without further explanation.</p>
          <p class="para">On our way back to the lobby, I wondered what your life was like all these years. How you, too, became an extraterrestrial biologist. I wanted to ask and make small talk, but I didn't know where to start. How do you make small talk after nine years of pretending the person didn't exist? A tiny part of me, the part where foolish hope resided, wondered if you were wondering the same thing, too.</p>
          <p class="para">"Two years on this ship." You paused, thinking. "Long mission, yeah?"</p>
          <p class="para">I nodded in approval. "Longest one I've been in. And to think we'll spend only seven days on the actual planet<span class="ellipsis">...</span>"</p>
          <p class="para">At the center of the lobby, in front of a large hologram where bold letters read <span class="display">AWAITING LAUNCH</span> and <i class="italic">Hypatia</i> rested on its launch pad, we sank into an awkward silence.</p>
          <p class="para">You broke it with a new question.</p>
          <p class="para">"So when do we take off?"</p>
          <p class="para">Actually, ground control had given me the green light hours ago. I guess I wanted to feel grounded a tad longer before embarking on a journey through the cosmos with you. You who had brought me excitement, warmth, nostalgia then sorrow; you who I once knew, really knew, then didn't know, and never understood.</p>
          <p class="para">"Whenever you're ready."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scene">
          <p class="para">Days passed since we had launched into the stars. We settled into a rhythm, found structure in our routines. There was always a report to write up, a ventilator to repair, or a system check to complete. When I did have time, I killed it as I usually would: by tending the greenhouses, making sure they'd be in perfect condition when we arrived with the samples. I liked these sanctuaries of life. I regulated the humidity of the soil, checked its chemical composition, fixed a heat-light here and there. But those days, more than ever—perhaps because I had never been on an interstellar voyage, perhaps because you were my partner—my routine echoed a tale of lone survival in a marine alien world, where unfathomable waters stretched across the planet, their depths filled with beings of wonder and peril.</p>
          <p class="para">Long ago, when the skies turned dark, when the singular amber lamp bathed the basement in a halcyon glow, we played that game for hours on end.</p>
          <p class="para">We almost beat it. We swam into the depths and sought relics of an underwater civilization. We befriended great creatures of awe and confronted beasts of terror. We completed every mission, collected all but one final piece necessary to build that fabled rocket and escape<span class="ellipsis">...</span></p>
          <p class="para">Then we drifted apart, and we never saw the ending.</p>
          <p class="para">A low-high chime lifted me from my recollection. It was my watch, telling me dinner had been served. I headed for the lobby as thoughts of otherworldly oceans swirled away.</p>
          <p class="para">You were always reserved when we ate, speaking matter-of-factly, never sharing more than was prompted, seldom asking questions in return. But I didn't want to quit, didn't want to grow quiet, too, and float away again. So I kept the conversations running, offering anecdotes of increasing length and personality. I guess I was always the more expressive one.</p>
          <p class="para">One night, I thought you talked more than usual. I hoped you had started thawing, that it wasn't merely wishful thinking. And you did, albeit very slowly. You began recounting your life, a tiny piece at a time. Over the span of several weeks, we caught up with each other. Somewhat.</p>
          <p class="para">I learned you had dropped out of civil engineering to shoot for the stars instead. Two years of aerospace engineering, actual rocket science, and then you fixed your gaze on extended biology. Otherworldly formations of life, silicone- based organisms, the whole shebang. You were one hell of a dedicated student, putting twice the effort of your peers in your research and exploration. You set yourself apart, graduated <i class="italic">summa cum laude</i>, became an extraterrestrial biologist, and, after a year of training and two years of work, received a call one winter morning to undertake a mission immediately for a considerable recompense.</p>
          <p class="para">So here you were.</p>
          <p class="para">I received no such academic distinction. I had simply been at the right place at the right time. They needed assistants, and despite falling short of excellence, I was competent, boasting a major in computer science for astronomy and a minor in spacecraft maintenance. So I had joined the cosmic frontier. Being a swift learner and quickly adapting to life in a spaceship, I soon began visiting planets and helping with research, and, as I left work one winter afternoon, I was assigned a two-people mission to collect samples of local flora and fauna on planet 4547B.</p>
          <p class="para">So here I was.</p>
          <p class="para">Our lives had crossed paths by sheer chance thirteen years ago. It was as if they had been bound to converge again.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scene">
          <p class="para">One night, after putting the dishes in the washer, I asked if you wanted to spend some time in the lounge. You had seemed troubled that day and used words sparingly during dinner, so when your eyes grew vacant, and you took a long pause, I thought you would surely come up with a reason to refuse. Too tired, perhaps. My heart sank alittle. It's weird to still feel attached, what with thirteen years since our last spark and nine years since the—</p>
          <p class="para">"Sure, why not. I don't have much tonight anyways."</p>
          <p class="para">My eyes dilated. It took me a second to respond.</p>
          <p class="para">"Cool," I said, with a nod to offset the brevity.</p>
          <p class="para">The lounge was not a spacious room, but it felt comfortable, almost welcoming. It had been designed to be old-fashioned, offering recreation of yore. The only modern entertainment it boasted was a holographic television, opposite of which there lay three bean bag chairs—red, white, red—and a small, low bench on which was placed a deck of cards. Further back in the room, there were tables for table tennis, air hockey, and foosball.</p>
          <p class="para">Upon laying my sight on the foosball table, two memories resurfaced.</p>
          <p class="para">The first, thirteen years prior, outside theatre 12 where we had finished a late-night full holo showing of some three-hour science-fiction epic. By the end, we had crossed into that ethereal realm where the world faded away. That floaty land of rapture so rarely entered, whose gate only opened after our shadows had disappeared, after we had broken all facades and barriers and defenses, when we melted and reshaped and fused into something greater than ourselves. So we shared stories and histories, talked about everything and laughed at nothing, and spared a few coins to play foosball but instead lost ourselves in words and warmth and the beauty of that buzzing theatre in an undying night of feverish friendship.</p>
          <p class="para">The second, ten years prior, the night before graduation and the inevitable start of adulthood, in our high school lounge to play a game "for old time's sake." It had been our first sustained conversation in a while, our dialogue for the past months amounting to nothing more than small talk when we saw each other in the hallways and quick inquiries about impersonal aspects of life. You talked about a breakup and saving up for a hovercar and your sister annoying the living shit out of you; I talked about the future and astronomy and destinations unknown. You said, "Honestly, who cares? I'll figure that shit out when I get there." And I wondered, what had happened to the man who once had a vision, who once scolded himself for missing the day's exercise? And as the foosball game continued and I felt but a husk of our erstwhile fire, I wondered, what had happened to us?</p>
          <p class="para">"Down for a game of speed?" I tilted my head towards the cards.</p>
          <p class="para">You nodded. We played. When I beat you, you shook your head dramatically and said, voice laden with mock defeat, "Not in my prime anymore. I would've whupped your ass ten years ago." I let out a chuckle, and you did, too.</p>
          <p class="para">Then you set your eyes on the foosball table.</p>
          <p class="para">It was a good night.</p>
          <p class="para">Now three memories surface when I see one. I especially dislike the third because it reminds me of everything that happened after, and everything that happened after makes my heart ache like nothing else can.</p>

        <div class="scene">
          <p class="para">Boy, am I a standout insomniac tonight. I risk a new glance towards the clock to learn it has been three hours since I turned off the lights. Doing my best not to disturb my wife, I creep off the bed slowly and tiptoe my way to the bathroom. The hallways are illuminated by eerie rays of streetlight, unusually bright tonight—so bright, in fact, that I didn't need to feel the walls at all to orient myself.</p>
          <p class="para">I cast a haphazard peek outside the bathroom window and the moonless night greets me with a sky alight.</p>
          <p class="para">Thousands upon thousands of little fires speckled the heavens. Tales of unimaginable forces billions of years in the making, players inconsequential as individuals but together constitute the play of the cosmos. The ultimate saga of life and death and evolution, told on an inconceivable scale.</p>
          <p class="para">Eighteen years ago—thirteen years before our story on <i class="italic">Hypatia</i>—we contemplated this intergalactical narrative in silence. Somewhere in the wilderness beside Lake Superior, on the edge of a narrow clearing surrounded by dense woods where mosquitoes abound, we lay without a word under the tender night sky. Far from the tents in the middle, far from the wavering campfire, far from the rest of the world.</p>
          <p class="para">Far from a changing reality. Far from our problems and concerns. Just you, me, the rhythmic chirping of crickets, and a cosmic painting of order and chaos. The air smelled of nature and liberty, somehow with a tint of lemongrass.</p>
          <p class="para">It was beautiful.</p>
          <p class="para">"It's beautiful," I said.</p>
          <p class="para">"Yeah. It's nice out here," you replied with a smile.</p>
          <p class="para">"I can't believe this is the last night already<span class="ellipsis">...</span> What do you think your dad planned for us tomorrow?"</p>
          <p class="para">"I don't know. Some more canoeing, maybe. A hearty lunch. But I don't think I convinced him, for the mountain." You sighed. "Too bad. The view'd been awesome."</p>
          <p class="para">"It's all good. He just wants us to be safe, I guess."</p>
          <p class="para">A long pause. You were thinking. Of what, I hadn't a clue.</p>
          <p class="para">"What are your plans after the summer?" As much as I'd have liked for the universe to put time on eternal pause for those two blissful months, the new school year was fast approaching.</p>
          <p class="para">"Do schoolwork as best as I can. Keep studying physics. I wanna get a part-time job, too, preferably one that pays more than minimum wage." You thought some more. "I don't know. More push-ups."</p>
          <p class="para">I chuckled. Of course. You had goals, challenges, and you weren't going to forget them. You would chase after them and never stop until you seized them by your hands and became one step closer to whatever you wanted. The best thing about you, the thing I wanted to learn for myself, was how you derived pleasure from not only your accomplishments, but your struggles towards them. Which created a stubborn, steady defiance against any setback.</p>
          <p class="para">I tilted my head towards you.</p>
          <p class="para">"Need to beat our game, then, before we return to the grind."</p>
          <p class="para">"Oh yeah. We could probably do that the day right after we get home. We're so close to getting the rocket's final piece."</p>
          <p class="para">"Mhm," I signaled in agreement.</p>
          <p class="para">And as a serene silence fell upon the clearing once more—we could do it easily now, share a comfortable silence—I returned my gaze towards the stars. There, beneath the constellations, vulnerable but warm, some unknown emotion suddenly throbbed inside me. It was novel and strange, and a trifle exciting. It evoked memories of our summer camp—and that incredible moment when we'd learned that we lived in the same town. And I thought about how crazy it was, that I'd only met you at the start of summer, that it felt like I'd known you forever.</p>
          <p class="para">And as the new feeling struck me again, I wondered if</p>
          <p class="para">(<i class="italic">hoped that</i>)</p>
          <p class="para">you felt it, too.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scene">
          <p class="para">I can't remember exactly when you started drifting away. Or <em class="italic">we</em> started drifting <em class="italic">apart</em>—I still don't know the answer to that question. I lean towards the former, but maybe I'm biased. I remember you telling me with delight how you'd be coming to my school for the new year. I remember our last night of the summer, where we played and talked and laughed and teased like we never would again.</p>
          <p class="para">Then I remember a different kind of life taking over, a life of endless tasks rolling on a conveyor belt, created by some unseen malevolent being with the sole purpose of congesting our time. The normal life, the real life, far from an idyllic summer without doubt or responsibility. But I reached out, no? I made an effort. Multiple texts in a day, sometimes, delivered without response until the next morning. I understood you had a busy life, too; I reminded myself of your vision. So I rationalized, eased my calls and messages, and searched for new pursuits.</p>
          <p class="para">As the year went on, our get-togethers became less and less frequent. And when we did see each other, there was a new part to you I didn't understand. I didn't know what it was at first, only that something felt off. But one day, I realized: you had started talking about others. What others had, how you thought about others, how others thought about you. And although you did your best to hide it, I saw you became aware of new things. Things I didn't particularly dislike to talk about, but uninviting things nonetheless. Things that wouldn't have belonged to our conversation six months ago.</p>
          <p class="para">Lunch with you became scarce. You had associated with new people, joined popular cliques, adopted your peers' values. And you laughed with them, prattled about the new things, engaged in the type of passive-aggressive banter that pervaded in those circles, and you seemed happy—but whether it was just a new act in the masquerade you had begun to play, or if you had truly forged a bond with your new companions, I could not tell.</p>
          <p class="para">I only knew you had changed. And with that knowledge came a pang of lament and jealousy.</p>
          <p class="para">I think you knew it, too. Or maybe I had pushed you away, been too insistent. But genuine discussion became a rare delicacy, those nights of words pouring from our hearts mere relics of a forsaken era.</p>
          <p class="para">I sought new people, of course, in a wishful attempt to fill the gap you had left behind. Tried turning acquaintances into something greater like a wannabe alchemist, spending months of frustration on metal that just won't turn to gold. Because that was all I had—acquaintances. I mean, you couldn't really do shit when everyone spoke through a facade, when they built twenty-foot-tall cinder block walls with embrasures to protect themselves from preemptive gunfire. So no, I didn't find anyone who matched your former carefree outlook, didn't find anyone who could wisecrack without a side of veiled barbs. Worse still, in my failure, I think I had given in a little, too. I think I had also started to build walls.</p>
          <p class="para">(Hell, it's two in the morning. Allow me to dramatize.)</p>
          <p class="para">Some nights, when thoughts of you kept me awake, that summer we shared felt like a fever dream. Surreal. Something that may as well have never happened. I remembered it as a series of fleeting sparks of brilliance, vague scenes of warmth and ardor that had enchanted me while they lasted. Had we really gazed upon the stars? Had we really told each other everything, shared our doubts and worries, questions and insecurities, when the lights went out but we'd been still awake? Then when our bittersweet story at last sang me to sleep, I'd have dreamed of us, the nights we shared, and a thousand possibilities that could have been.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scene">
          <p class="para">Summer came. I tried to reconnect, hoped we could return to what we once were. You accepted my sleepover offer, and we played <cite class="italic">Ares</cite> and watched <cite class="italic">The Beneath</cite> and babbled on about our thoughts and interests and obstacles again. It wasn't the blaze of words and frenzy I was once accustomed to, but it was a great start. The dark breaks barriers and evokes true selves, and that night, we were about as true as we could get after months of half-assed meetings.</p>
          <p class="para">We only met up a few more times that summer. The real life caught up to me on break, too, to jam more work up my ass. When I had time, you didn't: you had to work an extra night shift at the trampoline park, or spend the weekend at your girlfriend's cottage, or wage an everlasting war with the "plenty of shit on my plate," which sometimes meant going out with some guys from your circle. You had packed your life full with new priorities, and I doubted studying physics—hell, studying in general—or finding a job better than Minimum Wage Trampoline remained high on the list.</p>
          <p class="para">So your vision had changed, too. Perhaps you had lost it in the hurricanes of adolescence.</p>
          <p class="para">A hot August night one week before the start of junior year was the closest we had come—and would come, in the next decade before our fateful reunion on <i class="italic">Hypatia</i>—to rebuilding the connection we used to share. You had uttered a joke in perfect timing, I had replied with matching wit, and our back-and-forth piling on had triggered a belly laugh so potent the air was sucked out of our lungs. The latest action blockbuster was playing on the holoscreen, but our eyes were glued to the shifty ground, bodies contorted into uncharted territory from hysterical laughter. But as we quieted down, choking gasps followed by surviving giggles, I noticed a new air on your visage, a strange mix between apologetic and melancholy, as if sad that you had laughed so genuinely again. You wiped it off swiftly a few seconds later. At the time, I thought it was because the laughter had reminded you of last summer—our summer. At the time, I dismissed sightings of similar pensive expressions on your face as the works of nostalgia. Now I recognize it as something a lot more complex, as the impenetrable countenance of a lost and conflicted man, shipwrecked in the seas of time, marooned on the present's desolate island, stranded between past and future, youth and adulthood, uncertain about both, satisfied with neither, wondering what could have been and what might become.</p>
          <p class="para">So morning arrived and September arrived and eleventh grade arrived and you departed, the night before fading into but another bittersweet memory, as beautiful and transient as the autumnal afternoon sunshine, to be cherished and cursed for the years to come.</p>
          <p class="para">With every passing month you drifted further away. Our hanging out became weekly, biweekly, and then a time came when our dialogue declined to a perpetual small talk. No more inside jokes, no more recollections. Polite, standard, acquaintance-level small talk. And slowly but surely, the tiny part of me, the part where foolish hope resided, abandoned the possibility of returning to what we had been.</p>
          <p class="para">But I stopped knowing what that meant, yeah? What we had been. Or what I had been to you.</p>
          <p class="para">Had we really been that close?</p>
          <p class="para">Or was it merely the brain's embellishing to deny a harsh reality?</p>
          <p class="para">Doubts, regrets, and uncertainty—perhaps from you, too—it all came to a head the year we turned eighteen. We had moved out, gone to different universities, and hadn't contacted each other in a long time. One day, I learned from social media that you were visiting my city. So I reached out. Asked if you wanted to spend some time in this quaint little cafe not far from my residence, and you accepted. We began with detached small talk—oh well, it was to be expected—but somehow, you brought up the past. Then things took a turn. A series of wrong words and wrong names and wrong remarks, suppressed but rampant emotions unleashed, increasingly incendiary responses, and finally, I cracked the spark that ignited a fire. But this fire of words did not bring warmth and consolation, no; this fire was fueled by the bitter gasoline of slowly simmering sorrow that had started to sizzle and seethe, of regret fermented into resentment in the brewery of time, and oh, was it burning bright, its flames consuming all restraint and reason, its heat setting hearts ablaze, its thick, billowing smoke rushing out of mouths in the form of venomous sentences and permeating the air with the smell of anger and hurt.</p>
          <p class="para">I called you twice the following day. Unanswered. I sent you an apology, requested we meet in person to reconcile. No response. I checked your social media in hopes of finding an indication as to where you went. See if you were still nearby. But you had already removed my access.</p>
          <p class="para">Our story could have well ended there. An unfortunate tale of two souls, united by fate, separated by circumstance.</p>
          <p class="para">But the cosmos had other plans. The cosmos had a flair for the dramatic.</p>
          <p class="para">So we were destined for the stars. Destined to cross paths once more. So you received a call one winter morning to replace an ill Micheal on a two-year mission aboard a small biological research spaceship.</p>
          <p class="para">Because the cosmos wanted to write a tragedy.</p>

          <p class="para">"Yeah. I'd like to," I replied after a second of pleasant surprise.</p>
          <p class="para">I followed you through the azure gleam of the hallways and into the lounge, which had once only felt comfortable but, although we'd only been there for some chatter over quick games, became almost homey after several nights. You grabbed a control pad beside the holoscreen, rounded the low bench, and plopped onto the rightmost beanbag of an inviting red-orange. I sat beside you, snug in the middle cushion, and the holoscreen lit up at once with a blinding brilliance, and a soothing melody rang from the four walls as the screen dimmed to a navy blue. Then a single line of white text appeared in the center: <span class="display">SELECT ENTERTAINMENT USING THE HOLOPAD</span>.</p>
          <p class="para">"What are we watching?" I asked.</p>
          <p class="para">Your fingers casually swiped back and forth in the air, sifting through the movie selection projected by the slick rectangle you held in your lap.</p>
          <p class="para">"You'll see," you answered cryptically, smiling. "This movie just came out yesterday. Grab on to your seat—"</p>
          <p class="para">The room bursted into an otherworldly battlefield ruled by utter chaos, the fissured and tormented ground revealing unfathomable depths, the galaxy above tainted red from the scorched atmosphere. Fireballs bearing the infernal wrath of nuclear fusion erupted from all sides, obliterating cavalry and taking down the occasional hapless battleship which had sunk too low in a spectacular rupture of flames and shower of burning debris. But this wasteland of war and bloodshed was to me all too familiar. It had been the stage of the final battle of a legendary movie we'd seen thirteen years past, a three-hour science-fiction epic which had launched us into those clouds of fever and elation, where reality faded away and only we remained.</p>
          <p class="para">"—because we're in for a pretty wild ride."</p>
          <p class="para">And indeed, we were. The holoscreen's projections were as crisp as possible and allowed every action scene to play out in their full power and scale. The speaker-walls had incredible acoustics, and people sounded like they were really in the room. We made remarks about actors and scenes and inconsistencies and exchanged short tales that came to our mind, and steadily, our attention dripped away from the movie, yielding to conversation and banter instead. Two hours in, you even turned down the volume and immersion-level, reducing the film to background chatter.</p>
          <p class="para">Oh, we talked, all right. That night, we really talked. We talked about favorite movies and actors and this actor who had made an oopsie and was scrambling to salvage his career, beautiful soundtrack and liking new genres, not just action and sci-fi when we were fourteen, and that batshit-crazy horror film that came out last year, that no one had the balls to watch in full holo; other pastimes: mine—reading, currently a serial killer who bludgeoned his victims to death with fish, tending my roof-garden, where I secretly kept a specimen of some aquatic plant from one of my missions, hiking, but that's too much of a pain these days, driving two hours to the nearest forest<span class="ellipsis">...</span> yours—nice, you had an exercise routine, you picked it back up some years ago, gaming, you got tired of shooters and shifted to singleplayer narrative, currently playing a reboot of some famous interactive drama horror franchise of old, "reading, too, I guess; I've been chewing at this real piece of work, a friend told me I had to read it—<cite class="italic">House of Leaves</cite>—but it's a whole lot of—" and I was like, Holy shit, you're reading <cite class="italic">House of Leaves</cite>? (I read it the summer before senior year, a real something); colleagues—silly, lighthearted, favorite, stubborn, abso-fucking-lutely detestable—and stories, from a spilled coffee to a bitter rivalry, from a wild party aboard the <i class="italic">Zephyrus</i> to a relationship with the director—no way, I had said, eyes dilated, mouth agape, in prompting disbelief; "I wish I were joking" was your the start of your long reply, a ridiculous tale straight out of a comedy flick; then science and the monotony of spacecraft maintenance and the beauty of working with computers and astronomy, extended biology and how you nearly blew up the lab in the fifth year of university and how you were fascinated by the structure of otherworldly life, missions and operations and research, the joys of civil engineering, way back when—"thank God I finally decided to drop it," physics—hey, so you had picked that up, too, around the time you would decide to shoot for the stars—and nights of relentless studying, falling asleep in a pile of paper and open textbooks by toasty lamplight, but we'd made it in the end, yeah? we were on this ship, earning a comfortable salary, sitting in the lounge and chatting for hours on end; then a more distant past, an idyllic summer when the future had seemed nothing but bright, friends we had had then and who they were now, that is, mostly strangers with lives whose details you and I did not know, friends we had kept in contact with but had become mere acquaintances due to connections wearing thin—couldn't really meet in person much when your life was in the stars and theirs on the ground—and you and me, how it had been so, so long, and the things we used to do, remember that bike ride? way-past-bedtime pedaling at full force as the wind soared past our ears and a full moon shined whimsically in the night sky<span class="ellipsis">...</span> and the games we used to play, like this underwater world where mystery and wonder abounded, too bad we never saw its ending<span class="ellipsis">...</span></p>
          <p class="para">But I did.</p>
          <p class="para">"I actually stumbled across it, a few years later. When I was packing up for university."</p>
          <p class="para">That was a lie. One afternoon, my thoughts had wandered, decided to vacation in the past—its favorite resort—and, on a whim, I sifted through the old stuff and found the game under a Connect Four box.</p>
          <p class="para">"So I was just flooded with<span class="ellipsis">...</span> memories,"—that part was true—"and I was like, 'I gotta see the ending.' I had to finish the game."</p>
          <p class="para">Your expression grew from amusement to genuine curiosity.</p>
          <p class="para">"You built the rocket? Got the final piece?"</p>
          <p class="para">"Yeah, and I flew away. The planet grew smaller and smaller. Finally escaped, after the tireless hours we had spent gathering everything."</p>
          <p class="para">A wave of nostalgia washed over me, as it had done eleven years ago.</p>
          <p class="para">"But you know what really hit me? The credits, dude. It was with that freaking song, y'know, the one that played when the ship was about to explode?"</p>
          <p class="para">Your eyes lit up with recollection. The song that had indicated imminent peril, that had made our hearts pump faster than a horror flick in full holo.</p>
          <p class="para">"Oh shit, 'Abandon Ship'?"</p>
          <p class="para">"That's the one. Still as thrilling after all these years."</p>
          <p class="para">"Yeah, it's a damn good piece of music."</p>
          <p class="para">And we fell into a deep silence. One of the comfortable kind, of the kind we hadn't experienced in thirteen years, even though a melancholy note hung in the air.</p>
          <p class="para">"Hey, man. I want to<span class="ellipsis">...</span>" you started. Stopped. Cogs in your brain turned at full speed.</p>
          <p class="para">"I want to say sorry for what happened that day. I should have contacted you. I—all these years<span class="ellipsis">...</span>"</p>
          <p class="para">"Bygones. We'll let them be bygones. And I apologize, too. I said some things that day that I've wanted to take back ever since."</p>
          <p class="para">"No worries. Bygones."</p>
          <p class="para">And as we held eyes, any remaining ice melted entirely. Sublimed, even, by a reigniting fire. And in that moment, I really supposed that was what our bad moments had become—bygones. Forgiven, forgotten. Something flickered inside of me, a jumbling emotion I faintly recalled feeling thirteen years ago, an emotion on which I couldn't quite lay my finger. But it brought me warmth, peace, and a little something else, and it was pleasant, so I cast my thoughts aside.</p>
          <p class="para">In that dark lounge illuminated only by the navy blue of the sleeping holo screen, the future gleamed with possibility, and for the first time in nearly a decade, I thought we might just turn out perfectly all right.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scene">
          <p class="para">One night, I found you amongst the stars.</p>
          <p class="para">I had wanted to talk to you about some news article I had read. Just a conversation starter. I looked for you in the lobby, the cockpit, and the lounge, and when I couldn't find you, I headed for the habitats and knocked on your door. It was already half-opened, and my taps revealed an empty room. So I checked the greenhouses, the laboratories, and even the storage rooms—perhaps you had wanted to inspect them in detail, or had needed a specific repair tool—but my searches were again unfruitful.</p>
          <p class="para">Only one more place to look, then.</p>
          <p class="para">I went up the stairs and followed the narrow hallway to the entryway of the observatory.</p>
          <p class="para">The observatory was a dark and empty space, really wide—somehow even wider than the two-person cockpit. Closets flush with the walls were lined on both sides, containing high-reach telescopes, infrared binoculars, and other instruments used to observe the universe from every angle and under every lens. The space was a rounded cuboid, its sides a stony grey, everything designed to maximize comfort in watching the stars beyond. And the window to these stars beyond sat thirty feet into the observatory: a six-foot-deep glass protrusion, allowing for a panoramic view that stretched above one's head and below one's feet.</p>
          <p class="para">You sat in the middle of the glass, arms rested on your propped up knees, a lone shadow amidst dim streaks of pink and purple painted by billions upon billions of stars, looking so small from where I stood, looking so small in front of the cosmic canvas.</p>
          <p class="para">I walked towards you without a word, my steps crisply resonating against the titanium floor. As I grew closer, the sky grew larger, until it surrounded me entirely. Ethereal waves of light—dozens of shades of pink and purple, almost floral in their presentation—courted me from all sides, their contours and faces infinitely detailed with infinitesimal points of color. A fantastical dazzle of abstract forms and volumes, a galactical luster inspiring nothing less than awe and reverence—and, if I had seen this sight just a few months ago, perhaps a deep throb of melancholy. But not now. Now, as it had thirteen years ago, the vast night sky only evoked good feelings, warm feelings, and it was beautiful.</p>
          <p class="para">"It's beautiful," I said.</p>
          <p class="para">"No kidding," your voice rose from behind me.</p>
          <p class="para">I looked back, smiled, and sat down beside you, legs outstretched, palms lying on the glass behind my back for support.</p>
          <p class="para">Although the galaxy brought me comfort, I saw that the same could not really be said about you. You seemed stiff, somehow, eyes staring deep into the cosmos. You tried to hold a content expression, but I saw it waver, first into nostalgia, and then into a familiar pensive remorse—the one that had sometimes flashed across your face during our sparse get-togethers in highschool years. You quickly shifted back to a vacant serenity, of course—I wonder if you do it consciously, this smothering of disquiet—but I had already caught a glimpse of your uncertainty. I recalled that warm night at the lounge, when we had declared past conflicts bygones, and I wondered if there had not been some deeper, banished emotion at play, still unaddressed.</p>
          <p class="para">"Something on your mind?" I probed tentatively.</p>
          <p class="para">"Yeah." The word came out like a sigh.</p>
          <p class="para">I hadn't expected such a straightforward answer, so I figured you'd let me get straight to the point.</p>
          <p class="para">"What is it?"</p>
          <p class="para">You thought about that question pretty hard. Almost as if there was an objective right answer but you just couldn't figure it out.</p>
          <p class="para">"I don't know," you continued in that sigh-y voice. Your vacant stare remained glued to the stars. "That's part of it, I guess."</p>
          <p class="para">"Quit being so cryptic, partner."</p>
          <p class="para">Your lips parted, then closed. You tilted your head upwards. Were you holding back tears?</p>
          <p class="para">"It's just<span class="ellipsis">...</span>I don't know. Sometimes, I'm confused about something<span class="ellipsis">...</span>and I just can't—I never figured it out. Especially now because I never thought I'd—"</p>
          <p class="para">Your voice started wavering. Then you sunk into silence once more. I didn't know what to say; I could only look at you with listening eyes, hoping my presence was comfort—or comfort enough.</p>
          <p class="para">A tear streamed down your face, and upon seeing your lips waver—another failed attempt to articulate whatever had pushed that tear past your eye—the faintest recollection flickered in my mind.</p>
          <p class="para">The faintest recollection of a feeling that had been new and ephemeral, that had some incredible stretch of time ago impaled me with its embrace. And this turbulent expression of yours that had begun to eclipse your face since the end of that first summer—hadn't I often seen it after a glimmer of genuine warmth in the cold night? After a spark which that tiny part of me hoped can make you realize that we could still return to<span class="ellipsis">...</span> So now that tiny part asked, Might your sadness be rooted in our past, as mine had done? But then I heard a quiet weep, and this jumble of thoughts became too chaotic, and the faint recollection slipped away as quickly as it had floated into my wind, carrying an elusive answer into the dark.</p>
          <p class="para">You must have mustered every ounce of effort to suppress your whimpers, but you gave in to the tide in the end. Tears ran freely down your face and formed miniature pools on the glass floor while I tried to find my words and my stare meandered between you and the universe. All of a sudden, your watery eyes kindled in me a vague comprehension, and I knew what you wept for: an unhappy story, one told over the span of thirteen years. And I didn't know what to say, and words were pathetically insufficient in moments like these anyway, so I took you in my arms instead.</p>
          <p class="para">You accepted my embrace, the back of your head leaning against my chest, your sorrow leaving marks on my uniform. As your soft sobs began to let up, I recalled a night lost in the ebbs of time, a night when we had lain under a sky almost as clear as it now shone through the glass of <i class="italic">Hypatia</i>, when only insect-chimes and the gentle rustling of leaves filled the gaps of our voices, when that nameless yet powerful feeling of warmth and nervous enthusiasm dazzled me with its frenzy<span class="ellipsis">...</span></p>
          <p class="para">A whisper arose from your lips. In that dark observatory where the galaxy sparkled, you let out three words, and I began to understand.</p>
          <p class="para">"What were we?"</p>
          <p class="para">What <em class="italic">had</em> we been? I remembered you had drifted away. Or maybe I had tried to flee, too—to distance, to forget. But certainly not in the beginning. No, in the beginning, I tried everything to reverse the current that had begun to tug on you. Now I understood that in my attempts to hold onto your receding form, I had only pushed you further downstream. Now I understood that you never answered nine years earlier because a part of you wanted our story to come to a definitive end—the part of you that, in some strange understanding I could not explain, I knew had also refrained from swimming back in the years leading to the quarrel, had accepted the current, <em class="italic">welcomed</em> the current—for reasons still beyond my grasp but whose roots I could feel growing across my subconscious, ready to sprout at any moment. So in a disconnected, fragmentary way, I understood your question and your confusion, but I couldn't express it in words, couldn't encode a decade of sentimental turmoil in language, so instead of telling you how I felt and asking you how you felt and attempt to sort everything neatly like I did my emails and files, I breathed, "Pardon?"</p>
          <p class="para">You didn't move. You simply asked again, with a shakier voice, "Thirteen years ago, Connor. What were we?"</p>
          <p class="para">And those reasons came back, the reasons for which you had departed; they germinated, grew into skyscraping structures of possible answers, and I saw us again beneath the stars. I wondered if you had really felt it, too, that throbbing blaze sparked by word-heat and intangible connections, and did it maybe storm you with an unprecedented uncertainty? Were you afraid? I saw you adrift in the tempest of fervor, cast away on youth's desolate island, torn between and apart by an evolving bond you did not understand and a future of new people and new pressures, terribly uncertain about both, finding sense in neither, wondering what had really been and what could really be.</p>
          <p class="para">I answered your question with complete honesty.</p>
          <p class="para">"I don't know."</p>
          <p class="para">You didn't speak for half a minute. Then, a sudden string of faint sounds in the dark: "What are we now?"</p>
          <p class="para">I thought about when I had seen you for the first time in nine years. I thought about how you warmed up over mediocre meals, lounge nights, and repair sessions. And I realized I didn't have the answer to this question, either—but I knew what I would have wanted it to be. Maybe because that strange feeling never disappeared entirely throughout the nine years of absence; maybe it was simply hidden somewhere, nestled in the crevices of my mind, deactivated until consecutive sparks lifted it little by little from the depths of the dark and into the spotlight—and I think, the night we talked for hours on end in front of the sleeping holoscreen, maybe they did. I guess I never really abandoned this tale, never wrote "The End" and closed the book. I had held onto the pen and waited for a miraculous encounter to write a new chapter, and that tiny part of me, the part where foolish hope resided, never fell apart. And now that part said, Maybe there lay dormant in you some tiny piece, too, a piece that had never wanted to go, to dissociate, but instead for that strange feeling to burn brighter.</p>
          <p class="para">So I proposed, "Whatever we want to be."</p>
          <p class="para">You spun your head back and looked at me with a relieved smile through glistening eyes. A new teardrop breached your eyelids and slipped out with the plump glee of a child coasting down a slide; it streamed down your cheek and voyaged across its landscape, a lone cartographer who mapped your profile and traced your contours before it rounded into <i class="italic">terra incognita</i>, lost its tenuous grip on the cliff, and fell into the vast outside air. Your irises glimmered impossibly in the dark night, as if there were specks of light radiating within—as if they were colored by stars, the fluid dashes of amber and green resembling the streaks of twinkling pinpoints under which we had once lain. I think I shed a tear then, too, because the feeling which had struck me with its piercing intensity that summer night now resurged with thrice its former force, only this time I was certain you felt it, too. And in an unspoken exchange of electric fervor, I knew you wouldn't run from it, either.</p>
          <p class="para">And that changed everything.</p>
          <p class="para">As the freckled cosmos beyond the glass somehow glowed brighter, as our proximity charged the air with an all-consuming force beyond my understanding, I finally understood what I had felt thirteen years ago—finally lay my finger on it, you could say.</p>
          <p class="para">Under those bright but faded lights, you had set my heart on fire.</p>
        </div>         
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 id="five">Five</h2>
        <div class="scene">
          <p class="para">Then all hell broke loose.</p>
          <p class="para">Oh, fuck me. The more I don't want to get here, the more my thoughts converge towards it, right? It's near three-thirty now, and I'm still awake. I've been feeling sleep creeping ever closer for the past<span class="ellipsis">...</span>God, I don't know how long. Not like it matters; I knew sleep wouldn't come before I replay this part. When something's on your mind and you just can't drift into the black, sleep is cruelly tantalizing, isn't it? Always on the edge, always out of reach. Oh, here we go, the sights are coming, everything happened so fast, why did it happen so <em class="italic">fast</em>—one second I held you in my arms, our faces both wet with cleansing tears, and the next there came a sickeningly low <i class="italic">bong</i>, a reverberation so powerful it shook my insides—</p>
          <p class="para">Then three things happened at once: synthetic voices and sirens came from all sides, cruelly unseen speakers that screamed of urgency, a cacophony of sharp, rising-and-falling screeches and "Hull breached—consult your nearest screen for details"; our hands moved to our chests in unison, pressed the red buttons thrice and shouted, somehow in sync, "Emergency cover," whereupon the uniforms dispensed translucent films that quickly wrapped us from head to toe, forming bizarre outer skins; from somewhere in the middle of <i class="italic">Hypatia</i> there erupted a deafening explosion that dwarfed the initial <i class="italic">bong</i> and blasted through the second-floor walls, hurling flaming chunks of metal in all directions at devastating speeds.</p>
          <p class="para">It was as if a fiery tornado had torn through the ship. It was apocalyptic.</p>
          <p class="para">An incandescent lump the size of a bowling ball hurtled right above my head and missed my life by a foot, flying into the observatory window with a thunderous thud. I recoiled from its blinding heat.</p>
          <p class="para">I spun wildly in search of you, vaguely aware of the swooshing sound from air rushing past my oxygen film–covered ears. That meant the ship was depressurizing, the life-gas leaking into the interstellar void, which gave us two minutes, give or take—the time it took to exhaust the emergency oxygen stored in the uniform before an oxygen canister was attached—to reach the nearest emergency panel.</p>
          <p class="para">I found you on my right, curled up on the ground, your face in a painful grimace and your hands, powerless, on a burning piece of titanium wedged deep into your left thigh. Your film was ruptured. You made convulsive gasps for breath and the radio picked up weak murmurs for help. I rushed towards you and wrenched the piece out of your leg, hooks protruding from its far edge ripping out rags of flesh. You contorted in agony. With relief I noticed the emergency film began mending itself as soon as the intrusion was removed, finally allowing you to breathe, and secreted medical fluid into the wide gash before tightening around the tear in a makeshift tourniquet. But it was bad, really bad: half of your left leg was soaked in blood, and it didn't seem like it would stop bleeding soon.</p>
          <p class="para">The world seemed to stretch and shift. I helped you up—<i class="italic">please you have to walk you have to</i>—supported you on my right, and headed for the hallway. You limped heavily but we made progress as we navigated through burning debris and raw, sparking cables. Sirens continued to blare from seemingly everywhere and the hallway lights became a glaring white—they didn't want to soothe us with that mild azure anymore when shit hit the fan, I suppose. Damage to the middle of the second floor was extensive—the explosion gouged out a sick kind of atrium where mangled wires and tubes hung from the jagged edges of the floors and twisted laboratory equipment burned in haphazard piles. It was unlike any fire I'd seen; the initial explosion must have had combusted the chemicals in the storage rooms to release a mutated blaze that ignited everything in its path. As we neared the closest emergency panel, you were almost struck by a collapsing ceiling tile; I pulled you just in time, causing a wince from you at the sudden movement in your leg—which was now entirely covered in a horrible viscous crimson. My fingers trembled as I took the oxygen tanks from their case and coupled them to our uniforms. The added weight further hindered your strides.</p>
          <p class="para">"Where<span class="ellipsis">...</span>where to, now?" you asked weakly.</p>
          <p class="para">I looked at the gaping hole four yards to our right and caught a glimpse of the lobby, which was half destroyed, too: the red hologram atop the round table, showing all the places where <i class="italic">Hypatia</i> was messed up—that is, half of the ship—flickered and glitched, while slabs of metal burned in brutal dents on the ground. A third of the lobby sank into the hole, revealing a sub-level mangled beyond recognition—lacerated machinery, spilled liquids, uprooted cables and pipes, more infernal fire. That must be ground zero; it was a miracle the hull had not been blasted open when the explosion had rent everything else to shreds. I had a feeling fire extinguishers wouldn't do the job anymore; nor would pulling a lever here and there in the cockpit. <i class="italic">And SHIT, <i class="italic">Hypatia</i> runs on nuclear fuel, so the fire hasn't reached it yet because oh, God knows what will happen if—fuck me, it's probably a question of <em class="italic">when</em>—the fire spreads to <em class="italic">that</em> part of the sub-level<span class="ellipsis">...</span></i> No, that's it, the situation had gone beyond repair, the mission had to be aborted, so there was really only one option left—</p>
          <p class="para">"Escape pod," I replied.</p>
          <p class="para">When we went down the stairs, every step was a struggle. The first staircase we had found missed half a dozen steps in the middle, and a spiked and burning mess awaited our sorry asses if we fell—which was every bit probable, given your injury. So we had weaved through more flames to arrive at this narrow and steep staircase, but at least it was intact, and now we made our way down slowly, pausing every few steps to adjust your position. Your condition only worsened; it seemed to take a Herculean effort to put one foot in front of the other. Plump pearls of sweat broke out on your forehead—it had been getting hotter, hadn't it? And I thought the fires grew fiercer, too. The image of bright orange tendrils of fury setting plutonium alight sprang into my mind; I swiped it away, but it floated back a moment later like a fly insistent on provoking exasperation.</p>
          <p class="para">(<i class="italic">fire in the sub-level fire in the fuel nuclear detonation you're dead you're both dead</i>)</p>
          <p class="para">After escaping the staircase, we made it to the lobby, taking great care to stay away from the slanting edge. I saw the hologram much clearer now: pulsing red waves unrolled from a dozen places in the ship, their brightness indicating the severity of damage sustained—the sub-level glowed a harrowing scarlet—and an orange halo surrounded the tiniest white speck on the port of <i class="italic">Hypatia</i>. The point of impact. But at that point, I couldn't care less about what had hit the ship, or what harm it had done—but it wreaked havoc, all right—only that your blood loss was bad, really bad, and your eyelids were quivering. So I set my gaze on the hallway behind the lobby, and I kept moving.</p>
          <p class="para">Near the edge of the lobby, you collapsed on one knee with an awful <i class="italic">thunk</i>. The blood in your left leg had congealed into a dark unholy cast, but fresh life still oozed out of you in tributaries of rose and cherry. I tried for the second time that night to help you up—<i class="italic">oh please we're almost there you have to walk you have to</i>—but, this time, you slipped and tumbled onto the ashy ground, disturbed dust and ruin swirling in the air before settling snugly on your emergency film. The wound in your thigh, now submerged in pints of blood, spew out more gore from the crash. It stained the uniform around your torso with splashes of crimson, strangely evocative of an accidental spill on a near-finished canvas. I kneeled to one knee. From your face, as pale as the full moon, as cold as a starless night, there bulged your eyes, bloodshot and swollen, in which the amber-green streaks of its starry irises converged towards two dilating pupils, black holes in two spellbinding galaxies. You looked at me with an indecipherable air—not one of regret or sorrow, but perhaps a mix of defeat and vacant content—and I began to cry, drops of distress forming rivulets down my face, a tornado of thoughts ripping through my mind—<i class="italic">PLEASE we're almost there you can't do this you HAVE TO <em class="italic">WALK</em></i>—tearing at my chest and threatening my sanity. But then you raised a frail arm and wrapped it around mine and took my hand, and your words brought me temporary clemency from the chaos raging within and without.</p>
          <p class="para">"Too bad," you began. The radio gave intermittent static and you sounded so frail and<span class="ellipsis">...</span><em class="italic">dying</em>, but your voice was unmistakable. "Too bad 'Abandon Ship' wasn't playing, huh?"</p>
          <p class="para">I chuckled, breaking the sobs. I could almost hear the sirens picking up a sort of rhythm and acquiring pitch, morphing into the melodic urgency of that famous score to which we had once furiously maneuvered a game controller in desperate attempts to escape impending doom. Good times, they were. I sniffed and broke into a grin. Tasted salt. You looked like you'd also taken a trip down memory lane, revisited memories of a summer of yesteryear. As the edge of your lips inclined into a sad smile, my eyes went blurry again.</p>
          <p class="para">"You need to go on, Connor. Haul your ass to the escape pod, yeah? Time<span class="ellipsis">...</span> time is running out."</p>
          <p class="para">"No. No, you're coming with me. Come on, get up!"</p>
          <p class="para">Your voice grew weaker, but it was firm with icy rationality.</p>
          <p class="para">"We both know that's impossible."</p>
          <p class="para">I wanted to yell and scream and say <i class="italic">of course it's possible, why wouldn't it be, why wouldn't you just WALK</i>—but we both saw the blood loss. I also saw the vampire-white of your face and the slow decay of your eyes, ghastly moons and fading stars, and I knew deep inside that you wouldn't stand or walk again, that even if I dragged you you wouldn't be able to make the remaining distance to the escape pod, which was now as far and as indifferent as an intergalactic void—for your life was draining, leaking through a barbaric tear, and you spoke like a man whose last drops were about to run out. Cruel reality settled in, shattering all attempts at denial, as I realized what you were doing.</p>
          <p class="para">You were spending your final breaths to bid me farewell.</p>
          <p class="para">Aboard a collapsing ship, surrounded by hellish fire, I picked you up and held you in a tight embrace. Tears soaked the collar of my uniform. The world around us blurred out of focus. Another explosion roared from somewhere, probably at the back of the sub-level, and more chunks of debris battered the world, but I didn't care anymore: let the metal bellow and shriek, let the fire ravage and wreak; so what, if we died here when we had all we ever needed—</p>
          <p class="para">Your voice rose high inside my uniform. It exuded power. For a moment, I could have thought you were never injured.</p>
          <p class="para">"Promise me one thing, Connor."</p>
          <p class="para">The authority in your voice stifled my whimpers. I tilted my head up and shifted it back, looking at you, waiting.</p>
          <p class="para">"You'll run right now. You will <em class="italic">not</em> pick me up. You'll make it to the escape pod, and you will <em class="italic">live</em>. Promise me."</p>
          <p class="para">Your eyes were fierce. The wavering fire in them reignited in a brief blast of heat and burned bright like amber-green flares in raw Antarctic plains.</p>
          <p class="para">"I promise," I said between heaving sobs. You smiled, satisfied. If my making it out of here was your last wish, then I would do everything to see it fulfilled.</p>
          <p class="para">"Go on now. It's all right."</p>
          <p class="para">I stood up. I looked at the hallway. I looked at you.</p>
          <p class="para">Although your voice was but a whisper, the radio picked up your last words. Like that fiery instant in the observatory when we charged the air between us with electric understanding, you didn't say much, but you conveyed everything.</p>
          <p class="para">"And thanks, Connor. Thanks for having never given up on us."</p>

          <p class="para">I was staring out into cold interstellar oblivion when the world exploded.</p>
          <p class="para">Well, the world I'd known for the past seven months, at least. It went with a puny pop, though I'd bet the view on site was nothing short of calamitous—a calamity of biblical proportions. I mused on the possibility of you still being alive when it happened, what you would have seen in the briefest fraction of a second before a nuclear fireball lay waste to all, but I didn't linger long on the thought. I guess I'd already gone numb by then, as numb as a wanderer on a woeful winter night. So ended <i class="italic">Hypatia</i>: with a mild spark of light through the small window of a singly occupied double-seated escape pod in the middle of nowhere—at least to me. And as the spark extinguished, so ended you, another star to fade away.</p>
          <p class="para">Drifting through the night sky, I continued to contemplate the cosmos in silence. The stars seemed so far away, so unreachable. I thought they must be lonely because although they seemed clustered from this astronomical distance, surely they existed light-years apart from one another—well, save for the lucky few who danced in each other's pull. I imagined their lives on the cosmological time scale—but when faced with eternity, didn't everything happen in the blink of an eye? Stars: nothing but inconsequential players in the theatre of time. And the galaxies, oh, the galaxies, they were even further apart, separated by inconceivably vast chasms in which there was the only vacuum of space—in other words, nonexistence. Worse still, that sterile abyss would grow ever larger, and at one point it would consume every galaxy, isolating them in their personal purgatories, never to escape<span class="ellipsis">...</span></p>
          <p class="para">I wondered how stars and galaxies would feel if they could love.</p>
          <p class="para">And how they'd feel if they could grieve.</p>

          <p class="para">The rest went by in a blur: my rescue—successful, your recovery—not, the return, the funeral, the futile counselling, my resignation, moving across the country, leaving the vestiges of my old life behind in an attempt to forgo and forget.</p>
          <p class="para">You'd think time would relieve the pain. But it's been five years and here I still am, looking into the vast dark of the bedroom cut only by a strand of starlight, softly skewered and roughly caressed by the blankets and snares of memories.</p>
          <p class="para">Because the past doesn't let go so easily.</p>
          <p class="para">Or maybe I don't. It doesn't matter.</p>
          <p class="para">Sometimes, right before falling asleep, I'd remember our first week together: meeting you over summer dusk, heated by a dainty campfire that seemed to shrink the universe to its immediate vicinity, everything beyond its shimmer unknown and unknowable; knowing you in the subsequent nights, warmed by a different ethereal fire that seemed to create a universe out of the space between two souls, everything beyond its radiance detached and irrelevant.</p>
          <p class="para">As that spectral fire dissipates, replaced by the coldness of space, I finally tumble into black.</p>
          <p class="para">I dream of a bygone friend and distant night skies.</p>
